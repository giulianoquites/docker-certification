# Basics

An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

A container is a runtime instance of an imageâ€”what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.

# VS Code on Headless Pi

[Edit files on Pi from PC](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioCodeRemoteDevelopmentOverSSHToARaspberryPiIsButter.aspx)

# Troubleshooting

* When getting EACCESS permission denied, saving files with Visual Studio Code on host
```
sudo chown -vhR dockeradmin /home/dockeradmin
```

* SSH from VSCode is repeatedly failing:

Enable root login on the pi so you can run commands without sudo

Login, and edit this file: `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
Find this line: P`ermitRootLogin without-password`
Edit: `PermitRootLogin yes`
Close and save file
reboot or restart sshd service using: `/etc/init.d/ssh restart`
Set a root password if there isn't one already: `sudo passwd root`

For this message when service starts: 
```
NanoCPUs can not be set, as your kernel does not support CPU cfs period/quota or the cgroup is not mounted
```

This is because you cannot control cpu limits on a Pi.
Remvove this from the docker compose file:
```
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
```

C:\Users\shail\.vscode\extensions\ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-0.50.1\out

I did some more experimenting and I've found a way that works. -o RemoteCommand=none is not the only thing in this extension that prevents VS Code from establishing a working ssh session after calling sudo -u newuser -i, we also need to remove bash so that VS Code does not start an additional shell session on the remote host.

Here's a HOWTO:

make sure that sudo -u newuser -i works in a regular ssh session without requesting a password
remove "-o RemoteCommand=none" and "bash" from extension.js like so
sed -i s/"-o RemoteCommand=none"/""/ ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-*/out/extension.js
sed -i s/"bash"/""/ ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-*/out/extension.js


# Digital Ocean

* Sign up for a free trial account at (Digital Ocean)[https://cloud.digitalocean.com]
* Create a Ubuntu droplet
* You will get an email with the IP address of the droplet and the root user & temporary password.
SSH into the droplet and change the root user password when prompted
```
ssh root@[droplet ip]
```
* Create another user for docker and give it sudo privileges
```
adduser dockeradmin
usermod -aG sudo dockeradmin
logout
```
* Now, you can SSH as the docker admin user
```
ssh dockeradmin@206.189.82.62
```
* Install docker by running this script
```
 wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shailensukul/docker-certification/master/Scripts/install-docker.sh | bash
```
